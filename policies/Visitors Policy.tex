\section{Visitors Policy}

It is my responsibility to keep your child safe whilst they are in my
care. Part of this is ensuring the suitability of any adults they come
into contact with during their time at the setting, I will do this by
~enforcing the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  All regular visitors to my home have a DBS Certificate (Formerly
  known as CRB) proving that they have been background checked.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I will not leave a minded child in a room alone with a visitor,
  regular or otherwise, unless I know they have been DBS cleared.~
\item
  I will not allow any visitors to take my minded children to the
  toilet or to change their nappies.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I will request identification from all visitors not known to me and
  will refuse entry if I feel unsure of them.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I will endeavour, when possible, to arrange for any maintenance work
  to my property to be carried out at weekends or during non-minding
  hours.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I will maintain a visitors' book that is available for you to look
  at, at any time.
\end{itemize}
