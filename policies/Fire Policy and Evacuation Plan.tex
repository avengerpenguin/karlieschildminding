\section{Fire Safety Policy}

In order to ensure the safety of all children in my care smoke alarms
are checked monthly and will be recorded in the fire folder. The smoke
alarm is located in the Hallway.

Also to ensure safety, fire control equipment is stored above my fridge
in the kitchen, in the form of a fire blanket and a fire extinguisher is
also stored in the kitchen

The children will be made aware of what will happen in the unlikely
event of a fire and a fire drill will be practised every 6 months, this
will be recorded in the fire folder.

\subsection{Fire Evacuation Plan}

In the unlikely event of a fire and emergency evacuation when I have
children in my care, I will follow this procedure:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Get the children out as quickly as possible. I will leave the house
  through the hallway and by the main front door, retreating to a safe
  distance.
\item
  I will close all the doors as I leave the house.
\item
  Once safely outside I will phone the fire brigade.
\item
  I will then phone the children's parents/carers or emergency contacts
  if they are not available.
\item
  Ofsted will be called to inform them of this incident.
\end{itemize}

I will always carry my mobile phone fully charged, the number of which
has been issued to all parents. All emergency contacts for each child is
stored on this phone.
