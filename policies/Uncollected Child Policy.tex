\section{Uncollected Child Policy}

The purpose of this policy is to explain the actions I will carry out if
a child is not collected by the closing time of the setting or by an
agreed time with the parent/carer.

I realise that sometimes you may be delayed in picking up your child due
to unforeseen circumstances. It is important that you inform me, as soon
as possible, if you know you will be late picking up your child. Late
collection fees will apply (these will be stated on your contract) but
please be assured that your child will be safely cared for until your
arrival.

If a child is not collected at the arranged time, and I have not heard
from the person collecting the child then the following procedure will
apply:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  After 15 minutes I will attempt to contact the parent/carer several
  times.
\item
  After 30 minutres, if the parent/carer is unable to be contacted, I
  will contact the emergency numbers given to me. I will try this
  several times.
\item
  If after 2 hours I am still unable to contact anyone, I will call
  The Bridge/DAT (Duty and Assessment Team) and follow their advice. Your
  child will be safely cared for at all times.
\item
  The incident will be appropriately recorded.
\item
  If The Bridge/DAT have had to be contacted then Ofsted will be notified.
\end{itemize}
