title: About Me…
save_as: index.html

Hi, my name is Karlie. I am 28 and I am a soon-to-be Ofsted-registered childminder living in the Walkden area — only a stone's throw from the train station and 5 minutes from Walkden centre. 

I have worked with children for over 7 years — from babies to children aged 14 years old — in a variety of settings, including private nurseries, children's centres, after-school clubs, primary schools and high schools.  I am trained in paediatric first aid, food hygiene, behaviour management, child protection, child development tracking and I am undertaking a child communication training course run by Salford Council. 

I like to encourage learning in a fun, interactive and safe environment and aim to ensure that each child reaches their full potential. I live in a three-bedroom house with my partner, Ross, and my daughter Isobel, who is 2 in November. My household is vegetarian, as are the meals that I provide for the children. My meals are home cooked, healthy, meat free and delicious, though I will serve meat to children if parents provide it in the form of a pre cooked packed lunch. 

In our home, we have a secure, enclosed garden and a lovely playroom for lots of fun and learning activities for the children to do. Activities include free/role play, arts and crafts, messy play, sensory play, baking, sand and water play and many more. Activities will be planned regularly to help your child learn and progress through the EYFS (Early Years Foundation Stage). 

I am less than 5 minutes' walk away from Parr Fold Park and am well-situated to visit toddler groups, play centres, the library and other amenities.

My services are available from 7:30am to 5:30pm, Monday to Friday and term-time only.

Alternatively, give me a call on 07756577027.
