Hi, my name is Karlie, I am 28 and I am an Ofsted registered Childminder living in the Walkden area, only a stones throw from the train station and 5 minutes from Walkden centre. 

I have worked with children for over 7 years, from babies to children aged 14 years old, in a variety of settings including private nurseries, children's centres, after school clubs, primary schools and high schools.  I am trained in paediatric first aid, food hygiene, behaviour management, child protection, child development tracking and am undertaking a child communication training course run by Salford Council. 

I like to encourage learning in a fun, interactive and safe environment and aim to ensure that each child reaches their full potential. I live in a 3 bedroom house with my partner Ross and my daughter Isobel, who is 2 in November. In our home we have a secure enclosed garden and a lovely playroom for lots of fun and learning activities for the children to do. Activities include free/role play, arts and crafts, messy play, sensory play, baking, sand and water play and much more. Activities will be planned regularly to help your child learn and progress through the EYFS (Early Years Foundation Stage)

 I am less than 5 minutes walk away from the local park and am well situated to visit toddler groups, play centres, the library and other amenities.

My services are available from 7:30am- 5:30pm, Monday to Friday term time only.
