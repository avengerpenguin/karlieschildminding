  <h1>About Me…</h1>
    
  
  <p>Hi, my name is Karlie. I am in my early 30s and I am an Ofsted-registered childminder living in the Walkden area — only a stone's throw from the train station and 5 minutes from Walkden centre. </p>
<p>I have worked with children for over 9 years — from babies to children aged 14 years old — in a variety of settings, including private nurseries, children's centres, after-school clubs, primary schools and high schools.  I am trained in paediatric first aid, food hygiene, behaviour management, child protection and child development tracking.</p>
<p>I like to encourage learning in a fun, interactive, safe, home style environment and aim to ensure that each child reaches their full potential. I live in a three-bedroom house with my partner, Ross, and my daughter Isobel, who is 3 years old. Our household is vegetarian, as are the meals that I provide for the children. My meals are home cooked, healthy, meat free and delicious (see <a href="/files/sample-menus.pdf">sample menus</a>), though I will serve meat to children if parents provide it in the form of a pre cooked packed lunch. </p>
<p>In our home, we have a secure, enclosed garden and a lovely playroom for lots of fun and learning activities for the children to do. Activities include free/role play, arts and crafts, messy play, sensory play, baking, sand and water play and many more. Activities will be planned regularly to help your child learn and progress through the EYFS (Early Years Foundation Stage). </p>
<p>I am less than 5 minutes' walk away from Parr Fold Park and am well-situated to visit toddler groups, play centres, the library and other amenities.</p>
<p>My services are available from 7:30am to 5:30pm, Monday to Friday, during term-time only.</p>
<p>For information and availability, please email me at

<p>Alternatively, give me a call on 07756577027.</p>
